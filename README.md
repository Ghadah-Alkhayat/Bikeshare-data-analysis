# Bikeshare data analysis
This is one of my projects for Data Analyst -Udacity nano degree- 

In this project, Python is used to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. I performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and wrote code to compute descriptive statistics.
