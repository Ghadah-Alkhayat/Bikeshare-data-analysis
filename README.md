# Bikeshare data analysis
This is one of my projects for Data Analyst -Udacity nano degree- 

## introduction:
In this project, I performed an exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. First, I performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems. Then, I wrote code to compute descriptive statistics.  Finally,  I compared the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. I also looked into the differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.
 
 ## used language:
 python: pprint, csv, and datetime packages
