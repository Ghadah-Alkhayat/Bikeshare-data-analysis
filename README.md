my projects for Data Analyst (Udacity nano degree)

1- Bikeshare data: 

In this project, Python is used to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. I performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and wrote code to compute descriptive statistics.  

2- Investigate a data set:
In this project, the dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row:\n",
    "‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.\n",
    "‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.\n",
    "‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, I will invistigate what factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment.\n",
    "Especially, I will explore the relationship between the scholarship and no-show. Also, I will look into patient's age and health condition to see if they have effect on no-show. Finally, I will check if receiving SMS-reminders would make patient show-up"
